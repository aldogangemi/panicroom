Pavlovian fear conditioning is a classical experimental paradigm used to study the acquisition and extinction of fear responses and represents a valid tool to study different aspects of fear and anxiety. 
Taking advantage of the benefits that Virtual reality (VR) offers to the psychology research in terms of ecological validity, standardization, safety, and therapeutic applications, we have developed "PanicRoom", a Pavlovian fear conditioning-extinction paradigm in VR. 
The executable of our VR-Paradigm is available for PC Mac & Linux Standalone and it can be used with Oculus Rift. To use it with Oculus Quest please use the cable Meta Quest Link.
